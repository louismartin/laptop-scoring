# Scrap, score and rank laptops according to your preferences
I wanted to buy a new laptop and be sure I bought the best.
I made this python3 tools to compare thousands laptops based on data from comparez-malin.com, videocardbenchmark.net and cpubenchmark.net.
The scoring is done taking account many specifications with custom coefficients.


## Install requirements
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start the notebook
Just start the notebook and have fun.
```shell
jupyter notebook laptop_benchmark_scrapper.ipynb
```
You can adjust the coefficients to your liking for the scoring.
